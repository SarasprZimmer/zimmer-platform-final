## 🚨 Issues Identified

### Critical Issues: 0
No critical issues preventing deployment.

### High Priority Issues: 0
All high priority issues have been resolved.

### Medium Priority Issues: 2
1. **ESLint Configuration Warning**: Admin dashboard has a minor ESLint config warning about "next/typescript" extension, but this doesn't affect functionality.
2. **Dependency Version Conflicts**: Minor version conflicts in Python dependencies (httpx version mismatch), but doesn't affect core functionality.

### Low Priority Issues: 1
1. **Pip Version**: pip is outdated (23.0.1 vs 25.2), but this doesn't affect system operation.
